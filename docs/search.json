Reck, 2022). The effectiveness of such treatments is limited by the lack of reliable biomarkers for predicting therapeutic responses (G. Morad, 2021).\nHere, we combined scRNA and deep TCR repertoire sequencing to explore clonal expansion in 15 NSCLC patients undergoing Immune Checkpoint Blockade (ICB) therapy (anti-PDL1)."
